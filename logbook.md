Power Measures according to the angle of the Pellin-Broca Prism:\
Maximum Power between 0 degree with -20 graduations on the screw and 0 degree with +20 graduations on the screw\
Graduations were identified with a black line om the top of the screw\
So, to maximize the power at the exit of the prism: \
**Put the turntable to 0 degree and align the graduation 0 on the screw with the black line on the top of the screw**

**Put the turntable to 0 degree and align the graduation 0 on the screw with the black line on the top of the screw**\

New Power Measures between each component with the angle of the Prism maximized\
Laser re-aligned\
**Laser Exit**: 32.8 mW \
**After the prism**: 22.5 mW \
**After the 1rst mirror**: 21.2 mW \
**After the 2nd mirror**: 19.9 mW \
**After the disk**: 19.5 mW \
**After the 3rd mirror**: 18.9 mW \
**After the 20cm focal lense**: 17.1 mW \
**After the 4th mirror**: 16.1 mW \
**At the focal point**: 16.8 mW

Measurement of the polarization of the Laser:\
(Angles are indicated with the line at the top of the polarizer) \
Maximum power of 13.31 mW at the angle 80° \
Minimum power of 0.04 mW at the angle 170° \
-> **Vertical polarization:** the white line behind the polarizer is placed vertically 

Extinction Ratio = Transmission perpendicularly divided by the Transmission alongside the polarization  
**Extinction Ratio:** 0.003 

Measurement of the spectral width : \
The spectral profile is in the 'Manuel PL' on Overleaf \
**Spectral width:** 0.0552 nm (Full-Width at Half-Maximum)
